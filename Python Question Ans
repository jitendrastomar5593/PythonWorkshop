""" 
Question 1:
You are tasked with writing a program in Python to calculate the average of three numbers.
Write a Python program that takes three numbers as input from the user and calculates their average.
Display the result on the screen.
"""
# Taking input from the user
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
num3 = float(input("Enter the third number: "))

# Calculating the average
average = (num1 + num2 + num3) / 3

# Displaying the result
print("The average of the three numbers is:", average)


'''
Question 2:
You are given a CSV file named "data.csv" that contains information about students in a school. 
The file has the following columns: Name, Age, Grade 
(Grades must be created dynamically using Python code & then saved into the "data.csv" file & 
then only it must be used). Write a Python program to read the data from the CSV file and 
calculate the average age of the students.
'''
import csv

# Read data from CSV file
with open("C://Users/shind/Downloads/Data.csv", 'r') as file:
    reader = csv.DictReader(file)
    ages = [int(row['Age']) for row in reader]

# Calculate the average age
average_age = sum(ages) / len(ages)

# Display the result
print("The average age of the students is:", average_age)


'''Question 3:
You are building a simple banking application using Python and OOP. 
Create a class called "BankAccount" that has attributes like "CustomerID", "Account_Number" and "Balance." 
Implement methods for depositing and withdrawing money from the account. 
Write a code snippet that demonstrates the usage of this class.'''

class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, customer_id, account_number, balance=0):
        self.customer_id = customer_id
        self.account_number = account_number
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
        print("Deposit successful. New balance:", self.balance)

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if self.balance >= amount:
            self.balance -= amount
            print("Withdrawal successful. New balance:", self.balance)
        else:
            print("Insufficient balance. Withdrawal failed.")

# Create an instance of BankAccount
account = BankAccount("C123", "ACC456")

# Deposit money into the account
account.deposit(1000)

# Withdraw money from the account
account.withdraw(500)

# Try to withdraw more than the available balance
account.withdraw(700)

# Print the final balance
print("Final balance:", account.balance)

'''

Question 4:
You want to scrape the title and price of products listed on an e-commerce website.
 Write a Python program using the BeautifulSoup library to scrape the title and 
 price of the first five products on the website and display them on the screen.
 
'''
# C:\Users\shind\PycharmProjects\pythonProject1> pip install requests
import requests
# C:\Users\shind\PycharmProjects\pythonProject1> pip install beautifulsoup4
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# URL of the e-commerce website
url = "https://www.amazon.in/gp/bestsellers/?ref_=nav_cs_bestsellers"

# Send a GET request to the website
response = requests.get(url)

# Create a BeautifulSoup object to parse the HTML content
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

# Find the container elements that hold the product information
product_containers = soup.find_all('div', class_='a-carousel')

# Iterate over the first five product containers
for container in product_containers[:2]:
    # Extract the title and price from each container
    title = container.find('h2', class_='a-carousel-col a-carousel-center').text.strip()
    price = container.find('span', class_='_cDEzb_p13n-sc-price_3mJ9Z').text.strip()

    # Display the title and price on the screen
    print("Title:", title)
    print("Price:", price)
    print()

'''
Question 5:
You have a dataset that contains information about the sales of different products. 
The dataset has two columns: "Product" and "Sales." Write a Python program using the 
Matplotlib library to create a bar chart showing the sales of each product.

'''
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample dataset
dataset = {
    "Product": ["VGA_CABLE", "LAP_CASE", "C_TYP_CORD", "D_TYP_CORD", "HDMI_CABLE"],
    "Sales": [500, 800, 300, 200, 600]
}

# Extract data from the dataset
products = dataset["Product"]
sales = dataset["Sales"]

# Create a bar chart
plt.bar(products, sales)

# Set labels and title
plt.xlabel("Product")
plt.ylabel("Sales")
plt.title("Product Sales")

# Display the chart
plt.show()
